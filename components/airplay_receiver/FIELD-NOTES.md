# Field notes -- what hardware taught us

Findings from running this component on Amped-ESP32-S3 boards (Boston X90 pair,
Geneva Model M) against iOS and macOS senders. Everything here was measured on
hardware; where something is inference it says so.

**Read this before debugging audio artefacts.** Several obvious-looking leads
are dead ends and are listed as such at the bottom. This file is the subset of a
longer private deployment log that matters to anyone working on the component
itself; where a finding depends on evidence not reproduced here, it says so.

## The five failures that look identical from outside

All five present as **"the sender is connected, metadata and transport
work, and no audio comes out."** That symptom does not narrow anything down --
it is the default appearance of every serious bug in this component, because the
RTSP control socket is independent of the audio path. Do not treat it as a
clue.

### 1. The UDP receive queue was six packets deep

`CONFIG_LWIP_UDP_RECVMBOX_SIZE` is a **slot count, not a byte budget**, and the
IDF default is 6. ALAC realtime is 352 frames per packet, so 44100/352 = **125
packets/s** -- six slots is about 48ms of headroom on the audio socket.

When it is full, `recv_udp()` (`lwip/src/api/api_msg.c`) calls
`sys_mbox_trypost()`, and on failure deletes the packet and returns. No counter,
no stat, no error -- only a `LWIP_DEBUGF` that is compiled out. The packet was
received off the air, acknowledged at the 802.11 layer, and then discarded
inside the board. It surfaces only as an RTP sequence gap, which is exactly what
a packet lost on air looks like.

Measured on `boston-x90-r`, same source, same network, minutes apart:

| | duration | `holes` | `concealed` | seconds w/ NACKs | `under` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CONFIG_LWIP_UDP_RECVMBOX_SIZE=6` | 75s | **931** | 217183 | 72 | 0 |
| `CONFIG_LWIP_UDP_RECVMBOX_SIZE=32` | 80s | **0** | 0 | 0 | 0 |

`__init__.py` now sets this (and `CONFIG_LWIP_MAX_SOCKETS`) in
`_add_lwip_requirements()`. **Keep it there.** It used to live in the board YAML,
which meant the component silently mis-performed for anyone who dropped it in
without knowing. A board file that sets these itself will override the
component's value, so don't.

`SO_RCVBUF` cannot substitute for it: `CONFIG_LWIP_SO_RCVBUF` is off by default,
so lwIP compiles the option out and `setsockopt()` fails with `ENOPROTOOPT`. The
call in `socket_utils_bind_udp()` asking for 128KB is a **silent no-op** -- its
return value is not checked. Either enable the Kconfig or drop the argument; do
not leave it looking effective.

### 2. A superseded RTSP slot tore down its replacement

Reproduce by walking a phone out of AP range mid-stream and back.

The sender's RTSP socket dies without a FIN. There is no `SO_KEEPALIVE` on it,
and the header idle deadline in `client_task()` only applies once `buf_len > 0`,
so the slot's task stays blocked in `recv()` indefinitely -- nothing notices.

When the phone returns, `server_task()` calls `signal_old_client_stop()`, which
shuts the dead socket down **without waiting**, then immediately creates the new
client task. Both now run. The new one completes SETUP/RECORD and starts audio;
the old one wakes, reaches `cleanup:`, and emits `TRANSPORT_EVENT_DISCONNECTED`
-- which calls `audio_receiver_stop()` and `audio_output_stop()` on the session
that just replaced it, and `ap2_events_stop()` closes the encrypted event port
it just opened.

`slot->should_stop` distinguishes the cases: set by the server task when the
slot is superseded, clear when the sender itself went away. Only the latter may
emit `DISCONNECTED`. The disconnect log line prints `(superseded)` when the
guard fires.

A clean disconnect never races, which is why ordinary use never showed this and
a roam shows it every time -- the dead socket only wakes once the replacement is
already live.

### 3. The sender's PTP grandmaster stops sending (UNCONFIRMED)

A sender that stops sending PTP `SYNC` -- one that left the network and came
back without resuming its grandmaster role -- produces a symptom identical to
the two above, with the board innocent.

The chain, all verified in code, is worth knowing because every link is silent:

1. No `SYNC` reaches `ptp_task()`, so `ptp.sample_count` stays 0 and
   `ptp_clock_is_locked()` never goes true.
2. `audio_receiver_arm_engine_v2_anchor()` returns early on `!locked`, so the
   anchor is **never published** to the engine.
3. `clock_map->valid` stays false.
4. `audio_scheduler_render()` takes the `if (!clock_map->valid)` branch and
   calls `output_silence()`. Every render, forever.

Nothing logs an error anywhere along it. The RTSP session, metadata, the RTP
receive path and the NACK machinery all stay perfectly healthy, because none of
them need the clock.

**Diagnosing it takes one line.** `Anchor set: ... lead=N ms ptp_locked=0`:

- `ptp_locked=0` on every anchor is the fault.
- `lead` normally sits at -200 to -800 ms (the sender pre-buffers, so the anchor
  is slightly old). A `lead` of **minutes or days**, in either direction, means
  `ptp_clock_get_offset_ns()` is returning exactly 0 -- i.e. PTP has never
  produced a single accepted sample this session. It is not a timing error to
  be chased; it is the absence of a clock.
- The `unlocked: sync=.. announce=.. rejected=..` line (see below) narrows it
  but does not settle it: all zero means nothing is arriving, which is failure
  3 *or* failure 4 -- `quiet_event`/`quiet_general`/`rebuilds` are what separate
  a dead sender from a deaf socket. `rejected` climbing means packets arrive but
  the master filter drops them, which is neither.

Confirm the sender is still a grandmaster before concluding it is failure 3;
absent that check, failure 4 is the likelier reading.

### 4. The board's own PTP receive path went deaf

Reported 2026-09-09 on the same board: the sender is fine, the board has
stopped hearing it. The chain from step 1 onward is identical to failure 3, and
so is everything the telemetry shows -- `unlocked:`'s `quiet_event`/
`quiet_general` split is the only thing that separates them in a log, and by
hand the tell is that this one **correlates with uptime and clears on a board
power cycle**.

With failure 3's phone-reboot evidence retracted, this is the only one of the
two that any observed incident actually supports.

Two defects in the diagnostics for it, both of the shape "a check that looks
live while being structurally unable to fire":

- **The `unlocked:` budget was refilled inside
  `ptp_clock_set_master_clock_id()`**, which early-returns when the clock id is
  unchanged. A session whose sender reused the previous master got no budget and
  therefore produced no diagnostics at all -- and the fault is invisible without
  them. It appeared to work only because the master happened to change between
  the first two sessions. Refill belongs on `ensure_ptp_started()`, i.e. every
  session start, which is what it should always have keyed on.
- **`note_ptp_packet()` fed one `last_packet_ms` from both ports.** `SYNC`
  arrives only on the event port (319) and `FOLLOW_UP`/`ANNOUNCE` only on the
  general port (320). A deaf event socket alongside a live general socket
  therefore looks healthy to the receive-path watchdog: no `SYNC`, so no
  samples, so no lock and silence -- while the general port keeps resetting the
  30 s timer and the socket rebuild never runs. Nothing clears that state but a
  reboot.

Both timestamps are tracked per socket now; either going quiet triggers the
rebuild, and `unlocked:` carries `quiet_event` and `quiet_general` separately so
the next occurrence names the side that died.

Caveat worth preserving: the deaf-event-socket mechanism is **what the code
permitted**, found by reading it after a reboot fixed what a rebuild had not. It
is not confirmed as what actually happened. The counters were added to settle
that and had not yet caught an occurrence at the time of writing.

### 5. The buffered listener stayed bound to the previous sender's port

Reproduce by playing to the board from one device and then selecting it from a
second **without stopping the first**. Confirmed on hardware 2026-09-09; the
fix is deployed and takeovers work.

`audio_receiver_start_buffered()` skipped the restart whenever the stream was
already running, on the premise that "buffered streams use a fixed port". They
do not: `handle_setup()` calls `alloc_stream_port()` per RTSP connection and
the SETUP response advertises *that* port. So the second sender was told a port
the board was not listening on, its connect went unanswered, and the session sat
at `blocks=0` with the sender's UI showing "playing". Stopping the first device
first worked because TEARDOWN cleared `running`, letting the next SETUP bind --
that workaround is the tell for this failure.

An unchanged port must still skip the restart, or a repeat SETUP from the same
sender drops its own live connection; only a changed port stops and rebinds.
`buffered_start()` now returns `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` rather than success when
asked to serve a port it is not bound to. The realtime path never had this --
it has always restarted unconditionally.

Distinguishing it from failures 3 and 4 takes one field: this one is
`blocks=0` in `stalled:` **with the clock fine**, and the log shows
`(superseded)` shortly before. A PTP wedge is `clock_map=0`. Reading a
`Buffered audio connection closed by peer` line as the *new* sender hanging up
is the trap -- it is the superseded one's socket dying a couple of seconds
late.

### Why `START STALL` cannot save you here

`START STALL` is the watchdog meant to report exactly this class of wedge, and
it is structurally blind to failures 3 and 4, and to any other no-anchor case:
it is armed **inside `audio_engine_v2_set_anchor()`**, which is only reached
once a clock is locked. No lock means no anchor means the watchdog is never
armed, so the one failure it exists to report is the one it can never see. The
`unlocked:` counters exist because of this.

## Reading the telemetry

Three 1Hz lines, all at `ESP_LOGI`. Together ~3 log lines/s; `under=0`
throughout confirms the cost is not audible. `logger: level: WARN` silences them
without removing the counters.

```
playout: raw=.. span=.. filt=.. drift=..ppm trims=../s (N) buffered=N
         concealed=N holes=N (+N) under=N dfail=N qdrop=N edrop=N ins=N
resend:  sent=N recovered=N stale=N unmarked_ok=N unmarked_stale=N
rxpath:  stack=N task=N gap=N
```

- `holes` -- concealment *events*; `(+N)` is new ones this second. The number
  that matters. `concealed` is concealed samples.
- `buffered` -- healthy is ~250 blocks. Dips during loss bursts.
- `drift` / `filt` -- clock health. Healthy is +-40ppm and +-0.05ms. Wild values
  (hundreds of ppm, milliseconds) mean the problem is timing, not loss.
- `under` -- I2S underruns. Non-zero means CPU starvation of the playback task,
  a different problem entirely.
- `ins` -- steady ~125/s resampler insertion. Flat regardless of artefacts; not
  a fault signal.
- `resend:` is **suppressed entirely when every counter is zero**, so no
  `resend:` lines at all is the healthy state -- no sequence gap was detected.

A line that appears only while a stream is wedged, at `ESP_LOGW` so it clears
the `INFO` level the boards run at:

```
stalled: state=S reason=R clock_map=N epoch=N wanted_rtp=N blocks=N silent=N
         starts=N fallbacks=N concealed=N
```

It is the counterpart to `playout:`, which is gated on `AUDIO_SCHED_PLAYING`
and therefore prints nothing during the one fault worth watching. `reason` is
the field that matters, and until this line existed it was reachable only from
`START STALL` -- which, as above, can never fire for a no-anchor wedge.

- `clock_map=0` with `reason=WAIT_CLOCK_MAP` -- no usable clock. A PTP fault;
  read `unlocked:` next.
- `clock_map=1` with a preroll/fallback reason -- the clock is fine and the
  ring is not playable. Nothing to do with PTP; `starts`/`fallbacks` climbing
  says the scheduler is retrying and failing to find contiguous audio.
- It fires only when the sender has asked to play. An idle or paused board is
  silent on purpose and prints nothing.

A fourth line appears only when the clock is in trouble:

```
unlocked: sync=N followup=N announce=N rejected=N samples=N
          quiet_event=N ms quiet_general=N ms rebuilds=N master=<id>
```

Emitted at INFO, every 5 s. A session start grants
`PTP_UNLOCKED_STATUS_BUDGET` (6) reports, and the audio path re-arms reporting
on every render that finds an anchor pending with no clock
(`ptp_clock_notify_playing_unlocked()`, expiring
`PTP_STALL_NOTICE_TTL_MS` after the last call). So a session that locks
normally spends nothing, an idle board logs nothing, and a wedge leaves
evidence for as long as it lasts -- the budget alone used to go dark 21 s into
a seven-minute fault.

Read it as:

- **`followup` is the discriminator.** SYNC arrives only on the event port;
  FOLLOW_UP and ANNOUNCE only on the general port. ANNOUNCE climbing with
  `followup` frozen proves the general socket is fine and no master is emitting
  the sync pair -- the sender. `followup` climbing with `sync` frozen is the
  genuinely deaf event socket, and the only case a rebuild can fix.
- `quiet_event` high with `quiet_general` low is **not** diagnostic by itself:
  ANNOUNCE alone keeps the general timer fed, so a silent master produces it too.
- `rejected` climbing -> traffic arrives but the master filter is pinned to the
  wrong clock. A rebuild cannot help.
- `rebuilds` -> how many times the receive path was rebuilt (see below).

`ptp_task()` rebuilds both sockets, re-issuing their `IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP` join,
after `PTP_RX_SILENCE_TIMEOUT_MS` (30 s) with no datagram on *either* port.
This recovers a join that a switch pruned or a roam lost -- it cannot recover a
sender that has stopped transmitting, which is why the counters matter more
than the rebuild does.

`PTP <event|general> port receiving again after N socket rebuild(s)` reports a
recovery. The port name is load-bearing and was added because the line lied:
one shared `rebuilds_since_rx` was cleared by a packet on *either* port, so an
ANNOUNCE on a healthy general port announced the recovery of a still-deaf event
socket. It fired 40 times across a fault it was structurally unable to observe.
The counter is per port now, and only a port that was actually quiet when the
rebuild ran is credited with one -- otherwise the healthy port claims a
recovery every 30 s for as long as the other stays deaf.

The clock is started from `AirPlayReceiver::loop()` on the first pass with
`network::is_connected()`, not from the first RTSP session. `setup()` runs at
`AFTER_CONNECTION`, which is after the wifi component's `setup()` but before
association and DHCP, so binding there would fail. Starting at the session
instead cost ~3.5 s of the first play after a reboot and left the receive-path
watchdog stopped between sessions. `ensure_ptp_started()` in the transport is
still called per session: `ptp_clock_init()` is idempotent, and that call is
what re-arms `ptp_clock_notify_session_start()`.

`rxpath:` is what separates loss on air from loss inside the board, which
`holes` alone cannot:

- `stack` -- every UDP datagram that reached lwIP, from `udp.recv`, incremented
  at the top of `udp_input()` before the pcb lookup and before the receive mbox.
  This is what survived the air.
- `task` -- what the receiver actually read off the data socket. Nominal ~125/s.
- `gap` -- `stack - task`, dominated by receive-mbox overflow.

`gap` steady while `holes` is 0 is the non-audio floor: PTP on 319/320 plus
whatever mDNS the segment carries (~30/s on the reference network). The failure
signature is `task` dipping below 125 and then **overshooting** on the next
second while `stack` stays high -- the task draining a backlog after an
overflow. If `stack` falls along with `task`, the packets genuinely never
arrived and only the radio side can help.

Requires `CONFIG_LWIP_STATS`, which the component does **not** set -- it is a
diagnostic, not a requirement. Enable it in the board YAML when investigating;
without it the line compiles out via `#if LWIP_STATS`.

## Output DSP: what the design constraints actually were

`audio/audio_dsp.{h,cpp}` exists because a receiver fed directly by an iPhone has
no server-side EQ in front of it -- whatever the speaker needs has to run here.
Three constraints shaped it, and each one is a real failure if ignored:

- **Coefficient recompute is not realtime-safe.** Designing a biquad needs
  `sin`/`cos`/`pow`. Doing that on the priority-9 playback task starves the DMA
  ring and underruns. So every `audio_dsp_set_*()` runs on the main loop, fills
  the *inactive* one of two coefficient banks, and publishes by flipping a single
  index (release/acquire -- the writer and the playback task are on different
  cores). `audio_dsp_process()` reads the index once per block.
- **Filter state must survive a coefficient swap.** It lives outside the banks
  for exactly this reason. Zeroing it on every edit clicks once per knob turn.
  It *is* zeroed on flush and on session start, where stale state would thump.
- **Order in the chain is a headroom decision, not a response decision.** The
  stage runs last, after volume and channel mode. Response is the same either
  way, but filtering after the volume attenuation means a shelf with positive
  gain has room to boost instead of clipping at high volume.

The stage clamps on output, so a boost without a matching negative `preamp`
distorts peaks rather than wrapping. `warn_if_dsp_clips_()` names the preamp it
wants at boot. There is no limiter.

## Clicks on connect (mechanism inferred, not measured)

Selecting the board from iOS produced a run of clicks -- "click click click,
up and down, like the amp turning up and down" -- that Sendspin never made on
the same hardware.

Inside this component, exactly one thing touches the DAC clocks or the amp pin
during a session handshake: `audio_output_flush()`, which purges the DMA ring
by disabling and re-enabling the I2S channel. That stops BCLK/LRCLK, and the
DAC mutes and un-mutes its output stage around a clock dropout. `amp_set()` is
reached only by start/stop/the idle watchdog, none of which fire more than once
here, so elimination points at the flush -- **which is inference from the code,
not a measurement.**

The count fits. A single connect logs a burst of `audio: PAUSED` /
`audio: seek flush` / `start_stream` inside a second or two (four to six flushes
is ordinary), and every one of them purged the ring whether or not it held
anything.

The ring is `I2S_DMA_DESC_NUM * I2S_DMA_FRAME_NUM` = 2048 frames, ~46 ms. A
flush arriving when nothing but silence has gone out for longer than that has
no stale audio to drop, so the click was the entire effect. `playback_task()`
now purges only when `ring_may_hold_audio()` says a tail could still be in
flight; the `cursor_reset()` moved inside that branch, because it is correct
only as the accounting for a purge that actually discarded frames.

This does not touch a mid-playback seek, where the ring really does hold the
old track -- that flush still clicks. Silencing it would need a short volume
ramp around the disable/enable, which has not been written.

## Dead ends -- do not re-investigate

- **`handle_setpeers()` discarding the peer list** (`(void)raw;`) and the
  `SETPEERS: no timing peer (ip/port) available` warning. That is the AirPlay 1
  NTP fallback path; AirPlay 2 uses PTP and it locks fine (`ptp_locked=1`,
  `LOCKED: offset=.. dev=..`). Benign.
- **iOS answering NACKs.** It does not. Measured over 77 consecutive seconds:
  `sent=3-10/s recovered=0 stale=0 unmarked_ok=0 unmarked_stale=0`, every
  sample. The `0x80 0xD5` NACK is the AirPlay 1 / Shairport mechanism; an
  AirPlay 2 realtime stream (`type=96`, PTP-timed) ignores it. A lost packet can
  only be concealed -- which is why the mbox fix above mattered so much.
  (`sent` conflates new requests with retries: `resend_retry_if_due()` re-asks
  every 250ms while a gap is outstanding, so `sent=4/s` is often *one* gap
  retried four times.)
- **`tp=TCP` in the `_raop` TXT record** to request the buffered (`type=103`,
  TCP, loss-immune) stream. The sender still opens `type=96`. Kept because
  advertising the lossy transport was worse, but it is inert.
- **Feature bit 40 `SupportsBufferedAudio`.** Already set in
  `AIRPLAY_FEATURES_HI` (`0x1C340`). Buffered mode is the sender's choice and
  depends on the source app; it cannot be forced from the receiver.
- **Ping RTT as a wifi-health test.** It goes host -> router -> board and the
  host's own link confounds it. It got *worse* on one board after a power-save
  change that measurably helped. Use `playout:` and `rxpath:` instead.
- **Blaming airtime contention for concealment.** An earlier revision concluded
  this from a real A/B (0 holes with one receiver, 2-29/s with two) and declared
  it unfixable in firmware. The measurement was right and the mechanism was
  wrong: a second receiver does not change the first board's packet *rate* --
  the sender unicasts an independent stream to each -- it changes arrival
  *timing*, and a 6-slot queue cannot absorb the resulting bursts. Two boards at
  ~1.4 Mbit/s each is ~2.8 Mbit/s, which is nothing for 802.11n; that
  implausibility was the clue, and it needed no new measurement to spot.

## Log-reading traps

- **The `app:151` ESPHome version banner is re-emitted on every log client
  connect.** It is *not* a reboot indicator. Confirmed against boards that
  demonstrably never rebooted.
- **NACK send/receive logging is `ESP_LOGD`** while boards typically run
  `logger: level: INFO`. Absence of those lines means absence of *logging*, not
  absence of behaviour. This is why the 1Hz counters exist at INFO.
- Do not enable `audio_rt: DEBUG` to investigate loss -- it logs per NACK and
  per stale packet from the audio receive task, which can overflow the 768-byte
  task log buffer and cause the very stutter being measured.
- **ESPHome refuses a per-tag log level more verbose than the global level.**
  `logs: {airplay_ptp: DEBUG}` under `level: INFO` fails config validation, so
  an `ESP_LOGD` diagnostic cannot be switched on selectively -- it needs the
  global level raised, which makes every other tag chatty and reintroduces the
  stutter. Anything that must be readable on a deployed board has to be INFO
  and budgeted, not DEBUG.
- OTA fails while a stream is live (`Device closed connection without
  responding`) -- stop playback first. Flashing reboots the board, which drops
  the AirPlay session; the sender must re-select the speaker before the next
  capture.
